									<h2 class="major">Villans In DC Universe</h2>
									<p>Batman has one of the darkest and most memorable origin stories of all time: a young boy is on his way home after a night out with his parents, when suddenly, they're cornered by a petty thief in an alleyway. In an instant, the family he loved more than anything else in the world was gone forever. It isn't just compelling story writing; it helps us understand Batman's character on a deeper level, and just why he's out there risking his life against criminals every night in Gotham City. And when it comes to baddies, there's no doubt about it -- the Dark Knight has the baddest and most insane villains in all of comics.

But what about the villains' backstories? Oftentimes, we're so busy rooting for Batman to take down the bad guys that we forget to stop and think about who those bad guys were before they turned evil. Sure, some of the Bat's enemies (like The Joker) may seem irredeemable, but believe it or not, there's actually a number of villains that are just as sympathetic as the Caped Crusader himself. In fact, there are some that you might feel even more sorry for than the hero himself.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="Joker.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Joker (The Dark Knight)</h3>
											<p>he Joker is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, and first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman on April 25, 1940. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Death Stroke</h3>
											<p>Slade Wilson is a mercenary and assassin for hire with no qualms about crossing lines to get the job done, no matter where those lines are drawn.

												A formidable operative for the U.S. military, Col. Slade Wilson agreed to undergo an experimental process that increased his mental and physical abilities to superhuman levels. Rather than continue his career as a soldier, Slade became the masked mercenary Deathstroke. This decision resulted in his wife leaving him and his son Joseph being permanently injured, as well as the death of his son Grant, who sought to emulate Slade.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="Lex Luther.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Lex Luther</h3>
											<p>Lex Luthor was originally depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Since the late 1980s, he has more often been portrayed as the power-mad CEO of LexCorp. He wishes to rid the world of Superman, ostensibly because he views Superman as a threat to humanity, but in reality envies Superman's popularity and influence.[3] Given his high profile as a supervillain, however, he has often come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe.[4] Lex Luthor is physically an ordinary human and has no natural superpowers, but has above-average intelligence, a genius for inventions and a high command of science and technology. He occasionally wears his Warsuit, a suit of mechanized armor that gives him enhanced strength, flight, advanced weaponry, and other capabilities. While Lex is primarily depicted as a supervillain allied with other villains in the likes of Metallo, Parasite and Bizarro, and frequently leading DC supervillain teams such as the Legion of Doom, he has also been portrayed as an antihero who will ally himself with Superman and other heroes when situation calls for it.</p>
